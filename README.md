 LOGICYIELD is a project based on Data Analytics in which I have developed a web application to demonstrate how the Automotive Industry could harness data to take informed decisions.

Demonstrate the use of data analytics in identifying:
Customer segments, Most popular car specification combination (engine type, fuel, mileage, etc), choice of cars per age age group , Income vs Age group data visualisation, Statewise sales of cars for better understanding of the market etc.
